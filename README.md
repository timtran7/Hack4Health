# Hack4Health - Trakadilo
Trakadilo is a simple, intuitive web app that lets users track daily goals for calories, water intake, and sleep, supports guest mode and full user authentication, stores user-specific data securely so they can revisit it anytime, includes a built-in notes feature for journaling thoughts or habits, and displays progress bars.
You can run this project by creating a git codespace and then using streamlit run Project/Login.py in bash or the terminal. You can also run it by cloning it locally.
